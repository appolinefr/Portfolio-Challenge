# Portfolio-Challenge

## Description

This week's challenge was to create a portfolio page.

## The main acceptance criteria were as follow:

*ensure to include the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
*ensure the UI scrolls to the corresponding section when you click on a navigation link
*the developer's first application image should be larger in size than the others and should lead to the relevant page when you click on it
*make sure that the portfolio has a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
*deploy the page on github

This homework was overall quite challenging as there were a lot of acceptance criteria to meet. This challenge was particularly difficult for me as I struggle with design work and do not consider myself a very creative person! 

Creating the portfolio from scratch without any starter code was time-consuming but a great way to practice everything we have learned so far.

As part of this project, I was able to implement many features covered in class such as pseudo-elements and classes, flexbox and media queries. 

I feel this project taught me a lot and as a future web developper having a portfolio featuring projects built as part of the course as well as personal projects is key in showing your abilities and work.
